# Why VCS?

## 1. We want people to be able to work simultaneously, not serially.

## 2. When people are working at the same time, we want their changes to not conflict with each other.

## 3. We want to archive every version of everything that has ever existed — ever.

## *"We were in this bad spot where we had thousands of people who wanted to participate, but in many ways I was the break point. I could not really scale to the point where I could work with thousands of people. So Git is my second big project, which was only created for me to maintain my first big project. This is literally how I work. I don’t code for — well, I do code for fun — but I want to code for something meaningful, so every single project I’ve ever done has been something I needed and different."* - Linus Torvalds
