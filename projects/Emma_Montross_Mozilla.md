## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences): I am going to find and fix a beginner bug, either adding a few lines of (hopefully) python code or adding some more documentation. The Mozilla bug page is a little hard to read so I am still working on finding a bug.

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences): I use and trust Mozilla as a browser and I also use their email service Thunderbird. I like the company and believe it what they are doing. I think it would be a good project to start out on for open source.

## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences): Mozilla browser is used by thousands of people and they can use all the help they can get, especially for smaller bugs that may not be worth a more experienced programmer's time.
