## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences): I started this project at the T9 Hacks but was unsuccessful in getting it working. I am going to work with Taylor Andrews to create a slackbot for our senior projects slack that, when prompted, can tell a user what they committed to in stand-up that day and what is left on their task list.

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences): As team lead, I keep track of everyone's schedules and tasks. I am constantly updating various lists and trying to keep my team members on track. It would be great to have a projectbot that my members could ask for their daily tasks, especially when I am unavailable to answer questions.

## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences): The current project has a working chatbot that responds to a few commands and has code in place to get members' stand-up commitments but is having trouble actually listing those commitments. With Taylor and I both working on it, we can improve the stand-up functionality and potentially add other useful features. We could even possibly direct our projects professor to this project for future CS senior project teams to use to make their lives a bit easier.
