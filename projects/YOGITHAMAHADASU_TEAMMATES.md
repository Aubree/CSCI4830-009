## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences): 
TEAMMATES is a free online tool for managing peer evaluations and feedback paths of students. It is a cloud based service for faculty and students. This is a java based web tool and the project has around 200 contributors. I have good experience with web development and I am an Oracle certified Professional for Java. This product repository has 14 open issues for first timers and these include documentation, DevOps, Code Quality, Fault Tolerance, UIX and Performance issues. I plan to work on documentation issues while understanding their product, code and fix some of the UIX issues(1 open for first timers and 90 other open issues in UIX label). Upon understanding their product more and once I get comfortable in contributing to open source projects, I plan to work on some enhancement issues requested by users.

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences): 
I have been working as a teaching assistant for software development methods and tools for the past 2 semesters at CU and we extensively searched for a free tool which can help us in team formation, collecting peer evaluation from students on their project teams. We found a tool 'catme' which was not open source, very poorly documented and we ended up paying for survey monkey, a proprietary software. I can relate to this product, hopefully add more feature enhancements which I think are helpful from a faculty's point of view. Also, this project seems like a great start for a first timer like me, because they have great documentation encouraging new open source contributors.

## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
The count of the number of closed issues (3,932) shows that this product is currently being used by many universities. However, there are more 484 open issues and fixing some of these issues - to add missing documentation, to fix the UIX issues, to code enhancements for the product features will definitely benefit the users, by providing a quality free open source cloud based software.
